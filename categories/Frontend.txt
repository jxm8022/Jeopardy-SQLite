What are the five classes of HTTP responses?	<ul><li>Information responses (100-199)</li><li>Successful responses (200-299)</li><li>Redirection messages (300-399)</li><li>Client error responses (400-499)</li><li>Server error responses (500-599)</li></ul>
Name a few common status codes.	<ul><li>404 - not found</li><li>200 - ok</li><li>204 - no content</li></ul>

What is a component?	Basic UI building block of Angular. Subset of directives, always associated with a template. Modular piece/view of front-end.
What is directive?	Classes that add additional behavior to elements.
What are the three directives?	<ul><li>Component</li><li>Structure Directives</li><li>Attribute Directives</li></ul>
What is a structural directive? What are examples?	Controls whether it is rendered at run time, based on its input expression. Examples: *ngIf, *ngFor, *ngSwitch
What is an attribute directive? Give examples.	Allows elements to have dynamic behaviour. Examples: *ngClass, *ngStyle, *ngModel
What is a lifecycle hook?	"Functionality that allows the programmers to ""hook into"" and run code a specific lifecycle event of a component or directive"
What are a few lifecycle hooks?	<ul><li>ngOnChanges()</li><li>ngOnInit()</li><li>ngDoCheck()</li><li>ngOnDestroy()</li></ul>
What are two model bindings?	One way binding and two way binding
What are the three bindings in one way binding?	<ul><li>Event binding - (click)</li><ul><li>HTML -&gt; TS</li></ul><li>Property binding - [attr-name]</li><ul><li>TS to HTML</li></ul><li>string interpolation - {{varName}}</li><ul><li>TS to HTML</li></ul></ul>
What is two way binding and how do we achieve it?	Enables data to flow from the component to the view and visa versa. Achieved with the banana box [(modelName)]
What is a module?	Mechanism to group components, directives, pipes and services that are related.
What is a decorator?	Special syntax to let angular know that it is an angular element. The angular element contains metadata to a class, method, accessor, property, or parameter.
What is a pipe?	Simple functions to use in template expressions to accept an input value and return a transformed value.
What are a few build in pipes?	<ul><li>DatePipe</li><li>UpperCasePipe</li><li>LowerCasePipe</li><li>CurrencyPipe</li><li>DecimalPipe</li><li>PercentPipe</li></ul>
What is the difference between let and var?	<ul><li>Let is limited in scope</li><li>Var is not limited in scope, it is global</li></ul>

What is async in JavaScript?	Keyword placed before a function to allow the function to return a promise.
What is AJAX?	Asynchronous Javascript and XML. Allows web pages to be updated asynchronously by exchanging data with a web server behind the scenes. Makes it possible to update parts of the page, without reloading the whole page.
How do you create a new angular project?	ng new Project_Name<br><br>Follow-up questions when creating new project:<br>Would you like to add Angular routing?<br>Which stylesheet format would you like to use?
