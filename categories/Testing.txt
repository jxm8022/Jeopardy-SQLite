What is TDD?	Test-driven development. Creating test before developing the code. The life cycle is writing a test for single aspect of program(test fails because code is yet to be implemented), implement the code (test should pass), and refactor.
What is BDD?	Behavior-driven development. The life cycle is create the test set, implement the feature, and verify the implementation of the feature makes the tests succeed.
What is xUnit?	Open source testing tool for .NET Framework.
What is MOQ?	Mocking framework for C# and .NET. Used to isolate a class under test from its dependencies and ensure that the proper methods on the dependent objects are being called.
What is SonarCloud?	Cloud-based code quality and security service.
What is a CI/CD pipeline?	Continuous integration and continuous deployment. Process that drives software developement through a path of building, testing, and deploying code.
What is Karma?	Default test runner for applications created with Angular CLI. Browser test runner.
What is Jasmine?	Javascript testing framework.
What is unit testing?	testing method by which individual units of source code are tested to determine whether they are fit for use
How do you improve code quality?	"Multiple ways. Use immutable data structures, group related code, refactor, etc. More code quality rules can be found with this link.&nbsp;<a href=""https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fundamentals/code-analysis/quality-rules/"">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fundamentals/code-analysis/quality-rules/</a>. A few are:<br><ul><li>Do not declare static members on generic types</li><li>Do not expose generic lists</li><li>Avoid zero-length array allocations</li></ul>"
