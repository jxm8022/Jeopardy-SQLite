What is an ERD?	Entity relationship diagram. Flowchart that describes/illustrates interrelated entities in a specific domain of knowledge.
What is connected architecture?	Connection between database and application is established for the full time.

What is ORM?	Object-relational mapping. Technique that lets you query and manipulate data from a database using an object-oriented paradigm.

How do you connect to SQL database in ADO.NET?	Create SQL connection.<br>Provide connection string.<br>Open the connection.<br>*Make sure to close connection. This is an example for connected architecture.<br>*DataReader is an example for disconnected architecture.
