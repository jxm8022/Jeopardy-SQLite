What is OOP?	Object-Oriented Programming. Programming paradigm/model based on the concept of objects. Objects are entities of real world interpretations.
What are the OOP pillars? Briefly describe each.	"<ul><li>Abstraction - ""Hide"" unnecessary information to the user. Not needing to understand the implementation.</li><li>Encapsulation - Bundling of data and methods within one unit.&nbsp;</li><li>Inheritance - Allows one class to inherit/derive fields and methods of another class.&nbsp;</li><li>Polymorphism - Take on different forms. Common use: parent class reference is used to refer to a child class object. Example: Two classes(student, person), person object can be initialized to an instance of a student class. <i>Person person = new Student()</i>.</li></ul>"
What is SOLID?	<div>Object-oriented design principles.</div><ul><li>Single-responsibility - class should only have one job.</li><li>Open-closed - open for extension but closed for modification</li><li>Liskov Substitution - every child class should be substitutable for their parent class</li><li>Interface Segregation - client(code) should not be exposed to methods it does not need</li><li>Dependency Inversion - concrete implementation should come from abstract definition</li></ul>
What is dependency injection?	Design pattern which an object receives other objects that it depends on.
What is OWASP? Name one of the top 10 and describe it.	Open Web Application Security Project. Foundation to improve the security of software.<br><ul><li>Security Misconfiguration - configuration of security is unorganized. Example: default accounts enabled and unchanged. this allows access to unwanted users.</li></ul>
What is SOA?	Service oriented architecture. An architectural style that supports service orientation.
What is one SOA principle?	<ol><li>Standardized Service Contract</li><li>Loose Coupling</li><li>Service Abstraction</li><li>Service Reusability</li><li>Service Autonomy</li><li>Service Statelessness</li><li>Service Discoverability</li><li>Service Composability</li><li>Service Interoperability</li></ol>
What is HATEOAS?	Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State. Constraint of the REST application architecture that distinguishes it from other network application architectures. With this, a client interacts with a network application whose application servers provide information dynamically through hypermedia.
What is monolithic architecture?	Single-tiered software application in which UI and data access code are combined into a single program from a single platform.
What is the difference between authentication and authorization?	Authentication is verifying who someone is, whereas authorization is verifying what a user has access to
What are two SDLC models?	Waterfall and Agile
What is Agile?	An iterative approach to project management and software development. It helps deliver value to the customers faster.
What is scrum?	An agile process/methodology to focus on delivering the business value in the shortest time.
What is SDLC?	Software development life cycle. Process for planning, creating, testing, and deploying an information system.
What is REST?	Representational State Transfer. Architectural style for providing standards between computer systems on the web.
What are sprints?	Repeatable fixed time-box to complete a set amount of work.
What is MVC?	Model-view-controller. Software architectural pattern commonly used for developing user interfaces that divide the related program logic into three interconnected elements.<br><br>Example:<br><ul><li>model layer</li><li>business layer</li><li>data layer</li><li>user interface layer</li></ul>
